### Steps to Include Content Files in a NuGet Package

1. **Create Your Content Files:**
   Prepare your `_Layout.cshtml` and `MainLayout.razor` files in your project directory. 

2. **Edit Your `.nuspec` File:**
   If you are using a `.nuspec` file to create your NuGet package, you can specify the files to include in the package. Here's an example of what the `.nuspec` file might look like:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <package>
     <metadata>
       <id>YourPackageId</id>
       <version>1.0.0</version>
       <authors>YourName</authors>
       <description>A description of your package</description>
       <!-- Other metadata -->
     </metadata>
     <files>
       <file src="content\_Layout.cshtml" target="contentFiles\cshtml\_Layout.cshtml" />
       <file src="content\MainLayout.razor" target="contentFiles\razor\MainLayout.razor" />
     </files>
   </package>
   ```

3. **Include Content Files in the Project:**
   When using the newer SDK-style projects, you can directly specify content files in the `.csproj` file:

   ```xml
   <ItemGroup>
     <Content Include="content\_Layout.cshtml" Pack="true" PackagePath="contentFiles\cshtml\any\_Layout.cshtml" />
     <Content Include="content\MainLayout.razor" Pack="true" PackagePath="contentFiles\razor\any\MainLayout.razor" />
   </ItemGroup>
   ```

4. **Build Your NuGet Package:**
   Build your project or use the `dotnet pack` command to create the NuGet package.

   ```sh
   dotnet pack
   ```

5. **Using the Content Files:**
   After the package is installed, users will need to manually copy these files from the `contentFiles` directory to the appropriate locations in their project, such as `Pages` or `Shared` directories.

### Example of Manual Replacement Instructions

You can include a README file in your NuGet package with instructions on how to use the included files. For example:

```markdown
# How to Use the Layout Files

After installing this package, you will find the `_Layout.cshtml` and `MainLayout.razor` files in the `contentFiles` directory of your project. 

1. Copy `_Layout.cshtml` to the `Pages` or `Shared` folder.
2. Copy `MainLayout.razor` to the `Pages` or `Shared` folder.
3. Adjust your `_ViewImports.cshtml` or `_Imports.razor` if necessary to include any namespaces used by the new layout files.

Make sure to backup your existing layout files before replacing them.
```

By following this approach, you provide flexibility to the user while ensuring that their existing setup is not inadvertently disrupted.
